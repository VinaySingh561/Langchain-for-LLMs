## LangChain for LLMs: Advanced Applications and Workflows

This repository demonstrates how to leverage LangChain for creating robust and scalable workflows with Large Language Models (LLMs). It covers practical applications such as question generation, multi-chain workflows, and integrating LangChain with tools like Groq and custom APIs.

### Features

Seamless Integration with LLMs: Example implementations using models like llama-3.3-70b-versatile.

Multi-Chain Workflows: Create sequential and parallel chains to execute complex tasks like generating restaurant names and corresponding menu suggestions.

Data Handling: Insights into managing raw data, handling missing values, and addressing over-volume issues.

Custom Prompt Engineering: Design tailored prompts for specific use cases, such as restaurant name generation or translating text.


## Use Cases
1. Restaurant Name and Menu Suggestions
Automate the generation of unique restaurant names and menu items using a multi-chain workflow.

2 .Input: Cuisine type
Output: Restaurant name and suggested menu items
Question Generation for Text Data
Generate meaningful Q&A pairs from text datasets, focusing on relevance and avoiding redundancy.

3 .Quantitative Data Insights
Handle trading data to identify anomalies, manage missing data, and analyze patterns over specific periods.
